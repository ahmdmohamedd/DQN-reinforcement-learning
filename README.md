## Introduction

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time. In this project, we use DQN to train an agent in the CartPole environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train the agent.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenAI Gym

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy gym
```

## How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**: The CartPole environment is created using OpenAI Gym, where the agent will learn to balance the pole.
2. **DQN Agent**: A Deep Q-Network is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The agent uses experience replay and an epsilon-greedy policy for exploration.
3. **Training**: The agent is trained over multiple episodes, updating its Q-values based on the rewards received from the environment.

## Training

The training process runs for a specified number of episodes. The agent's performance is printed after each episode, showing the score and epsilon value.

## Results

The agent's performance improves over time, as indicated by increasing scores. The training process demonstrates the effectiveness of DQN in solving the CartPole problem.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of Deep Q-Networks in reinforcement learning. The agent successfully learns to balance the pole through iterative training, demonstrating the power of neural networks in decision-making tasks.
