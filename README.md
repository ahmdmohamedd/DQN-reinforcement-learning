# DQN-reinforcement-learning
This project implements reinforcement learning using DQN in a Jupyter Notebook. The agent learns to navigate the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym, optimizing its actions through experience replay and epsilon-greedy exploration. The training process is detailed with performance metrics, showcasing the agent's improvement over episodes.
